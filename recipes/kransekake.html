            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Traditionally used for weddings, confirmations and holidays like Christmas and Norway's Independence Day, the kransekake is a towering cake made out of 18 crisp almond cookies "glued" together with icing. It's the epitome of Norwegian baking: Simple, elegant and minimal.</p>
            <p>Talk about a cake fit for a king! Or a god, in this case. Odin may have enjoyed this Scandinavian dessert at feasts or holidays.</p>

                <li>4 egg whites</li>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Grease your kransekake rings.</li>
                    <li>Stir together the almond flour and powdered sugar.</li>
                    <li>Add the egg whites and beat until dough clumps together.</li>
                    <li>On a powder sugar dusted surface, roll the dough into strips that are roughly the same thickness as your index finger.</li>
                    <li>Gently press the dough into the ring, trimming the ends so that they just overlap. Gently press together to seal.</li>
                    <li>Bake at 400F for 8-10 minutes, or until just golden.</li>
                    <li>In a bowl, whip the meringue powder and water until frothy.</li>
                    <li>Add the powdered sugar and whip until you reach a piping consistency.</li>
                    <li>Pipe the icing onto the rings and stack.
                    </li>
                    <li>Garnish with fresh flowers, cookies or candies.</li>
                </ol>
